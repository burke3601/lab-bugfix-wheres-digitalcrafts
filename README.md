# Where's DigitalCrafts?

This program displays the states which have cities named "Atlanta", "Houston", "Tampa".

# Bugs to fix

- [ ] After lots of debugging, code stopped running. `node index.js` does nothing
- [ ] Started crashing after adding "tampa" search
- [ ] Prints "Atlanta" locations twice (instead of Houston)

For each bug you fix, add documentation to this README about how you fixed it (include before/after code samples).

# For the more curious:

`db.js` includes more functions that you can try out. In `index.js`, try to `console.log()` the results of the following function calls:

- `getByAbbreviation('ak')`
- `searchByName('dakota')`
  - Why does this only return results for North Dakota (and not South Dakota)?

My Fixes
-"db" was not used for tampa
- wrong function for Houston
